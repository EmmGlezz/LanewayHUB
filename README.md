# Laneway Hub

Laneway Hub is a social media web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create profiles, connect with other students, trainers, and staff from Laneway Education, upload posts with pictures, and view other users' profiles. 

The app has Authentication and Authorization features that require users to log in or sign up before accessing any of the app's features, ensuring the security and privacy of user data. The app uses bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for generating and verifying access tokens, providing a secure and reliable authentication system. 

Users can also comment and like posts, providing an interactive social experience. The user interface is built using MUI (Material-UI) and other packages, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience. The app uses RESTful API architecture for handling HTTP requests and responses, ensuring efficient and scalable communication between the front-end and back-end.
